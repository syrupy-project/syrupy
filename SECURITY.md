# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

In general, we do not backport fixes to older versions of Syrupy due to maintenance cost. We may make exceptions on a case-by-case basis for high severity security vulnerabilities upon request.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, see: https://github.com/tophat/syrupy/security/advisories. If you do not receive a response within a few days, feel free to reach out to an admin on our discord server.
