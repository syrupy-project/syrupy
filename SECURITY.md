# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

In general, we do not backport fixes to older versions of Syrupy due to maintenance cost. We may make exceptions on a case-by-case basis for high severity security vulnerabilities upon request.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, see: https://github.com/syrupy-project/syrupy/security/advisories.
