# New Project Kit

## How to use this repository

This repository covers some must-haves when starting a project so you don't have to. Things like setting up a basic CI configuration, a README, issue templates and whatnot. Simply clone it and fill it up with your project's files! Everything you find in here is a suggestion rather than a prescription; don't feel obligated to stick to the templated format! After all, every project is unique in its own right.

To get started, take out this __How to__ section, replace __New Project Kit__ with your project's name and fill up the README template below!

__Nice-to-haves__
- A lot of projects have __a nice logo__ that catches the eye and builds branding, feel free to add one to your project!
- __Badges__ are a great way to visually represent the current state of your project, from CI to latest released versions.
- Don't forget to add in a badge for your project's [Maturity Score](https://github.com/tophat/getting-started/blob/master/scorecard.md)!
- __Screenshots or GIFs of your project in action__ can also be pretty cool to have in here!
